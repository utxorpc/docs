# Introduction

UTxO RPC (_u5c_ for short) is an interface tailored for interactions with UTxO-based blockchains, prioritizing performance and developer experience. By providing a common contract, a range of SDKs, and thorough documentation, UtxoRpc aims to facilitate seamless integration across an heteregenous ecosystems of clients and data providers. Utilizing event-driven patterns and the capabilities of Proto3, the interface supports efficient communication, cross-language compatibility, and adaptability between systems.

## Only a Specification

UtxoRpc serves just as a specification of an interface between agents and the blockchain, it doesn't provide any concrete client / provider implementations. The primary purpose of _u5c_ is to define a set of standardized methods, data structures, and communication patterns.

By providing a well-defined specification, _u5c_ encourages different actors in the ecosystem to contribute their own implementations while ensuring interoperability between them. This approach promotes collaboration and innovation among developers, as they can build on each other's work and leverage existing tools and libraries that adhere to the _u5c_ specification.
