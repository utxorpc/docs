# Build Module

The _Build_ module provides an interface for querying the state of the ledger and constructing transactions.

## Operations

- `GetChainTip`: This method retrieves the current chain tip, which represents the latest state of the blockchain.
- `GetChainParam`: This method allows clients to request specific chain parameters, providing essential information for transaction construction and validation.
- `GetUtxoByAddress`: This method enables clients to query UTxOs associated with a list of addresses at a specific point in the chain.
- `GetUtxoByRef`: This method allows clients to fetch UTxOs based on their references, which includes the transaction hash and output index, at a specific point in the chain.
- `HoldUtxo`: This method enables clients to hold UTxOs, preventing them from being spent, and receive updates about lost UTxOs in a streaming fashion.

  actor Client
  participant BuildService

  Note over Client,BuildService: query tip to define tx validity params
  Client->>+BuildService: GetChainTip
  BuildService-->>-Client: <tip>

  Note over Client,BuildService: query params to define fees / other criteria
  Client->>+BuildService: GetChainParam (<key>[])
  BuildService-->>-Client: <param>[]

  Note over Client,BuildService: query wallet UTxO to balance tx
  Client->>+BuildService: GetUtxoByAddress (address, acquire_point)
  BuildService-->>-Client: GetUtxoByAddress (items, next_token)

  Note over Client,BuildService: query UTxO by ref to resolve other inputs
  Client->>+BuildService: GetUtxoByRef (ref, acquire_point)
  BuildService-->>-Client: GetUtxoByRef (items, next_token)

  Note over Client,BuildService: monitor these UTxO because we plan on using them
  Client->>BuildService: HoldUtxo (refs)
  activate BuildService
  BuildService--)Client: <utxo 1 was lost>
  BuildService--)Client: <utxo 2 was lost>
  Client->>Client: construct / sign the Tx
  Client->>BuildService: Done
  deactivate BuildService
