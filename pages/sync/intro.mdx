# Sync Module

The _Sync_ module provides an interface for synchronizing chain data, fetching blocks, and tracking the tip of the blockchain.

## Operations

- `FetchBlock`: This method enables clients to fetch blocks by their references. Clients can selectively return fields using a field mask.
- `DumpHistory`: This method allows clients to dump a segment of the block history, starting from a specified point and up to a maximum number of items. Clients can selectively return fields using a field mask.
- `FollowTip`: This method enables clients to follow the tip of the blockchain by finding the intersection with a list of block references. The service will stream updates, including applying and undoing blocks or resetting to a specific block reference.

## Sequence Example

sequenceDiagram
  actor Client
  participant SyncService

  Note over Client,SyncService: fetch a particular block
  Client->>+SyncService: FetchBlock (<ref>)
  SyncService-->>-Client: <block>

  Note over Client,SyncService: dump history of chain in chunks of 100 blocks
  Client->>+SyncService: DumpHistory (origin, 100)
  SyncService-->>-Client: <block>[origin..100]

  Client->>+SyncService: DumpHistory (last_ref, 100)
  SyncService-->>-Client: <block>[101..200]

  Note over Client,SyncService: stream change events from tip of the chain
  Client->>SyncService: FollowTip (<intersection>)
  activate SyncService
  SyncService-->>Client: <apply>(block)
  SyncService-->>Client: <undo>(block)
  SyncService-->>Client: <reset>(point)
  Client->>SyncService: Done
  deactivate SyncService
```
